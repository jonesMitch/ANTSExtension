This project minimizes Lua files.

Set the folders to read and output Lua files in the config.json file.

You can set the specific file to minimize in 1 of 2 ways:

    You can hardcode the file name in the main method of Minimizer.py (the readFileName variable) to make testing easier

    Or you can enter the file name as the first command line argument
